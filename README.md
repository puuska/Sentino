# Sentino
## Shitty Discord bot written in NodeJS with help from Discord.js library
### To install:
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/puuska/Sentino.git
cd Sentino
npm install discord.js
```
After doing this shit, get bot token from [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), and invite your new bot with this URL `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0`. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` with client ID from Discord applications site.
When you will finally invite bot to your server, launch it with `node bot.js` command.
